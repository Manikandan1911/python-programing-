Here's a Python program to solve the given problem:

python
Copy code
# Take input for the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    # Take input for X and Y
    X, Y = map(int, input().split())
    total_payment = X * 10 + Y * 5
    # Print the total amount of money
    print(total_payment)
